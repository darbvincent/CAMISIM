onfiguration File Options
These is a list of all configuration options that are required for CAMISIM to run. Optional arguments are written in italic. The sections, denoted by the words in [brackets] are also required.

[Main]
seed=

An optional seed to get consistent results, if None is used, random seed is chosen
phase=

Starting point of the simulation
0: Full run
1: Only community design
2: Start with read simulation
max_processors=

Maximum number of processors used
dataset_id=

Name of the created sample
output_directory=

Output directory
Will be created if it does not exist.
Make sure directory is empty before running CAMISIM
temp_directory=

Path for storing temporary files of CAMISIM
Make sure enough space is available
gsa=

Whether a gold standard assembly should be created
May be True/False or Yes/No
pooled_gsa=

Whether a pooled gold standard over all samples is created
True/False/Yes/No
anonymous=

Whether the output is anonymized
Also True/False/Yes/No
Can be computationally expensive
compress=

Whether the data should be compressed or not
0 is for no comrepssion, 9 is maximum comporession
recommended is using compression level 1 at least
[ReadSimulator]
readsim=tools/art_illumina-2.3.6/art_illumina

path to the executable of the chosen read simulator
ART is shipped within CAMISIM at the above relative path
error_profiles=tools/art_illumina-2.3.6/profiles

Folder containing error profiles for the read simulators
Might be emoty for some simulators (e.g. NanoSim)
samtools=tools/samtools-1.3/samtools

Path to samtools executable
Version 1.3 (recommended) is shipped within CAMISIM
profile=mbarc

used read simulator error profile
mbarc is recommended for bacterial communities
choose for ART: mi/hi/hi150/mbarc
ignored by other read simulators
size=

size of a single sample in Gigabasepairs (Gbp)
actual size, including mapping files, might be larger
type=

type of the used read simulator
choose from art/wgsim/nanosim/pbsim
fragments_size_mean=

mean size of the fragments to be created
will be ignored by NanoSim
fragment_size_standard_deviation=

standard deviation of fragments to be created
will be ignored by NanoSim
[CommunityDesign]
distribution_file_paths=

optional path to input abundance files
files are tsv files of the format genomeTababundance
One per sample to be created
ncbi_taxdump=tools/ncbi-taxonomy_20170222.tar.gz

Taxonomy dump form the NCBI
Working version can be found at the relative path above
strain_simulation_template=scripts/StrainSimulationWrapper/sgEvolver/simulation_dir

Path to a template.tree for the sgEvolver from the mauve suite
Example tree is shipped along the sgEvolver itself within CAMISIM
number_of_samples=

Number of samples to be created
[community0]
metadata=

Path of the input metadata tsv file
file has to be in the format: genome_IDTabOTUTabNCBI_IDTabnovelty_category
And this line as a header
id_to_genome_file=

Path to the input genome_to_id tsv file
format is: genome_IDTabgenome path
No header
id_to_gff_file=

Optional file used by the sgEvolver, mapping togene annotations of the input genomes
genomes_total=

Total number of simulated genomes
Difference between genomes_total and genomes_real are simulated by sgEvolver
genomes_real=

Number of genomes used from the input genomes
max_strains_per_otu=

Maximum number of strains drawn from genomes belonging to a single OTU
OTU is taken from the metadata file
ratio=

ratio between different communities
default: 1, i.e. if only one community is present
mode=

mode for changing the abundances in different samples
one of replicates/timeseries_lognormal/timeseries_normal/differential
log_mu=

Mean of the used log-normal distribution
1 is an empirically good mean
log_sigma=

standard deviation of the used log-normal distribution
2 is an empirically good sd
gauss_mu=

mean of the used normal distribution
gauss_sigma=

standard deviation of the used normal distribution
view=

Show the used distribution of genomes before simulating
default: False
